this is a personal ongoing project on networking concepts.
----------------------------------------------------------
 A company operates two branches, Head Office (HO) and Branch Office (BO), in different cities. Each branch requires efficient 
 internal communication, seamless inter-branch connectivity via a WAN link, and secure internet access for all devices. The network 
design must be scalable to accommodate future expansions and departmental growth.

The objectives of this project are as follows:  
1. Building Two Networks:  
    o Design and implement separate networks for the Head Office 
      and Branch Office, including subnetting for departmental 
      divisions.  
2. Establishing a WAN Link:  
    o Connect the two branches using a reliable Wide Area Network 
      (WAN) link for inter-branch communication.  
3. Configuring Static Routing:  
    o Enable communication between the two networks by setting up 
      appropriate static routes.  
4.  Implementing a DNS Server:  
    o Deploy a DNS server to manage and resolve domain names 
      within the network efficiently.  
5.  Configuring Port Address Translation (PAT):  
    o Provide secure internet access to all devices using a single 
      public IP address.  
6.  Ensuring Scalability:  
    o Design the network to accommodate future departmental 
      growth and additional devices without requiring major 
      reconfiguration.
